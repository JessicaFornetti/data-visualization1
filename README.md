This project aims to find makeup retail brands insights such as the bestselling and most profitable products by brand using the following [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivd24coder/cosmetic-brand-products-dataset/). Two Tableau dashoards were created: an exploratory analysis dashboard and an insights dashboard which can seen below.

This project was completed as part of the course Master of Science in Computer Science (Data Science) at TU Dublin, Ireland.

This interactive dashboard which can found [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jessica.fornetti/viz/ItempriceAnalysisdashboard/ItemPriceAnalysis?publish=yes), explores the different product types filtered by brand. It highlights the minimum and maximum price by brand, the total number of products, the split by product type and the average price and rating per product type per brand.

This interactive dashboard which can found [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jessica.fornetti/viz/Insightsdashboard/Insights?publish=yes), focuses mainly on the pricing of items, to identify the most profitable brands. 
It highlights the top 10 most expensive items, the top 10 least expensive, the top 10 most expensive brands
and finally the top 10 best rated brands.
