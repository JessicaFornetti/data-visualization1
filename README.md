This project aims to find makeup retail brands insights such as the bestselling and most profitable products by brand using the following [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivd24coder/cosmetic-brand-products-dataset/). Two Tableau dashoards were created: an exploratory analysis dashboard and an insights dashboard which can seen below.

This project was completed as part of the course Master of Science in Computer Science (Data Science) at TU Dublin, Ireland.

# Exploratory Analysis Dashboard

For the 1
st dashboard, we have the exploratory analysis filtered by brand. We have the minimum and
maximum price by brand, the total number of products and the split by product type and finally the
average price and rating per product type per brand.

# Insights Dashboard

For the 2nd dashboard, the focus was mainly on the pricing of items, to figure out which brands were
the most profitable. As well we have the top 10 brands with the best rating.

# Repository Overview
This repository contains a [Tableau file](Assignment1.twb) used to create the dashboards above and a [report](Assignment1.pdf) describing the dataset, the visuals and previous iterations.
